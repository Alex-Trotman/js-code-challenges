The code challenges within project-assessment-prep are meant to help you prepare for the live coding during the project review.

The challenges within the extra-challenges directory are not meant to be tackled during the Review Session unless you have already worked through all of the challenges within the project-assessment-prep directory during this Review Session.

TO BEGIN:
CD into the project-assessment-prep directory. Then, you'll need to cd into each sub directory as you work through the problems. Start at the top (filter-and-list-corgis) and if time allows, continue working down the list. The problems become more challenging as you progress - with sorting-with-dom-manip being the most challenging.

When pair programming, one person will take the role Navigator and the other will be the Driver. Check out this resource for more info on the roles: https://dev.to/documatic/pair-programming-best-practices-and-tools-154j

Please be courteous and allow everyone in your group the chance to experience each role during the Review Session. Keep talking with your partner(s)! 

Have fun!
